This is a cute woodland game inspired by the game snake.

The main character of this game is a deer and it can move with the cursors.

You can touch bunnies and have them follow you, but if the train of bunnies runs into eachother it is game over.

Foxes try to eat the bunnies following the deer, and turn them into carrots if they do. You can kill the foxes by pressing f.
If the fox eats all the bunnies then he will eat you and it will also be game over.




Our project is built off of the framework of our Project 5, however everything but the abstract classes were pretty much removed.
Partners:
    Katie:
        -made the deer class, made it the main character, and allowed it and the screen to move with the cursor keys
        - added the parsed functions and removed all the old entities from the structure we built it off of
        - made the fox class, made them turn what it ate into carrots
        -fixed how the rabbits followed so it was like a train instead of an L
        -made the fox die if F is pressed

    Ria:
        - made bunnies move randomly, and follow deer if touched
        - make game over if deer touches its tail
