This is a cute woodland game inspired by the game snake.
The main character of this game is a deer and it can move with the cursors.
You can touch bunnies and have them follow you, but if the train of bunnies runs into eachother it is game over.
occasionally a fox will spawn and start eating the bunnies off the train, turning them into carrots. You can kill the foxes by clicking them with a mouse.
if the fox eats all the bunnies then he will eat you and it will also be game over.

        -made the deer class, made it the main character, and allowed it and the screen to move with the cursor keys
        - added the parsed functions and removed all the old entities from the structure we built it off of
        - made the fox class, made them turn what it ate into carrots
        -fixed how the rabbits followed so it was like a train instead of an L

    Ria:
        - made bunnies move randomly, and follow deer if touched
